## Description

Six degrees of separation is the theory that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world, so that a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps

## Task

In this coding challenge the degrees of separation between actors should be identified. Two actors are related if they played in the same movie.

## Examples

- The degree of separation between "Owen Wilson" and "Vince Vaughn" is "1" (direct connection) because they acted together in "The Internship" & "Wedding Crashers"
